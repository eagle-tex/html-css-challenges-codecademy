        In Cuba, a popular dance known as Casino
        <sup><a href="#casino">(1)</a></sup>
        was marketed abroad as Cuban-style salsa or Salsa Cubana to distinguish
        it from other salsa styles when the name was popularized in the 1970s.
        Dancing Casino is an expression of popular social culture in Cuba and
        many Cubans consider casino a part of their social and cultural
        activities centering on their popular music.
      </p>
      <p>
        The origins of the name Casino are casinos deportivos, the dance halls
        where a lot of social dancing was done among the better off, white
        Cubans during the mid-1950s and onward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically, Casino traces its origin as a partner dance from Son
        Cubano, fused with partner figures and turns adopted from the Cuban
        Mambo, Cuban Cha Cha Cha, Rumba
        <sup><a href="#rumba">(2)</a></sup>
        Guaguanc贸 and North American Jive. As with Son, Danz贸n and Cha Cha Cha,
        it is traditionally, though less often today, danced a contratiempo.
        This means that, distinct from subsequent forms of salsa, no step is
        taken on the first and fifth beats in each clave pattern and the fourth
        and eighth beat are emphasised. In this way, rather than following a
        beat, the dancers themselves contribute in their movement, to the
        polyrythmic pattern of the music.
      </p>
      <p>
        Casino dance is often intertwined with Afro-Cuban dance traditions,
        which many dancers spontaneously draw from in a more or less structured
        or ad hoc fashion, though this is not per se definitory of the dance
        itself. In the same way that a sonero (lead singer in Son and Salsa
        bands) may "quote" other, older songs in their own, a Casino dancer
        frequently improvises references to other dances, integrating movements,
        gestures and extended passages from the folkloric and popular heritage.
        This is particularly true of African descended Cubans. Such
        improvisations might include extracts of rumba, dances for African
        deities, the older popular dances such as Cha Cha Cha and Danz贸n.

      <h2>Culture and geography</h2>
      <p>
        Culturally, Casino is danced as an interplay between genders and feeling
        the music (Sabor) as its main ingredients. Much of the interplay of
        Casino style dancing is based on the broader Afro-Caribbean cultural
        context with emphasis on sexual interplay, teasing and everyday
        experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Geographically, in Latin America, Casino and its variants are danced in
        Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. It is also popular in
        Europe and parts of Asia.

      <h3>
        As a partner dance (
        <em>Parejas</em>
        )
      </h3>
      <p>
        Casino is danced in three points which makes up a circular motion as
        partners face each other in intricate patterns of arms and body
        movement. This is distinctive from the North American Salsa styles which
        is danced in a slot (two points) and linear positions as taught by the
        North American and European dance studios.
      </p>
      <p>
        Casino has a number of basic steps. One of them known as guapea
        ("swagger") or pausa, among other attested names, involves the leader
        lead performing a more or less pronounced dragging of his left foot
        backwards from a slightly advanced onset position. This is in stark
        contrast to the most common basic Salsa step, in which the lead steps
        forward with his left foot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Casino styling includes men being "macho" and women being femininely
        sexy, with major body and muscle isolations, through the influence of
        Rumba dancing. During the dance, dancers often break from each other
        during percussion solos and perform the despelote, an advanced form of
        styling in which the male and female partner get physically close and
        tease each other without touching through the gyrating of hips and
        shoulders while performing muscle isolations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The major distinction of Casino Styling is that male partners have
        tendencies to show off (following Afro-Cuban Guaguanc贸 influence), under
        the cultural guise of males having to attract attention and tease
        females. This is the major point of differences between Casino and
        Northern American forms of Salsa, which ascribe to the ballroom adage of
        "men are the picture frame while women are the picture."

      <h3>
        As as solo dance (
        <em>
          Suelta
          <sup><a href="#suelta">(3)</a></sup>
        </em>
        )
      </h3>
      <p>
        <em>Suelto</em>
        , dancing salsa without a partner, originates from stage singers and
        dancers, who perform dance routines during orchestra and live
        performances. Dancing alone or in a group (usually with a male facing
        females on the dance floor), the movements are based on a-tiempo or
        contra-tiempo, with intricate footwork and lively body movements.
      </p>

      <h3>Other forms of partner dancing</h3>
      <p>
        Other partner dancing styles include Trios or Quattros, in which a lead
        dances with two or more partners in intricate patterns. There is also a
        Trios version in which two leads share a follow. Additionally, several
        couples can come together to dance choreographed moves with changes of
        partners, led by a caller and known as "rueda de casino". This last form
        is popular everywhere there is Cuban music. In the United States, many
        dance schools only offer rueda de casino and ignore completely the dance
        of casino. These schools often mistakenly idenfitify the dance as
        "casino rueda" or "salsa rueda", both incorrect terms.
