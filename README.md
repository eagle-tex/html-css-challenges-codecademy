# Projects

## Project 01 - Create a tribute page

Choose a historical figure who's meaningful to you and create a webpage
dedicated to them. The webpage should include:

- A title or heading with the person's name
- An image of the person
- A caption for the image
- A timeline of the person's life in the form of a list

This can be completed with only HTML, but use CSS to give it some style.

## Project 02 - Create a Wikipedia page

Wikipedia is one of the backbones of the internet, and it has a relatively
simple layout. Create a Wikipedia page on the topic of your choice. It should
include:

- A title or heading
- A table of contents with links to sections within the page
- Superscript number links that link to the corresponding number in the
  reference section
- An ordered list of references

# Project 03 - Create an HTML and CSS-only search results page

Create a mock Google search results page. It should include:

- The Google logo
- A search bar at the top
- A list of search results with clickable links
