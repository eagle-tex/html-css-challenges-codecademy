# Projects

## Project 01 - Create a tribute page

Choose a historical figure who's meaningful to you and create a webpage
dedicated to them. The webpage should include:

- A title or heading with the person's name
- An image of the person
- A caption for the image
- A timeline of the person's life in the form of a list

This can be completed with only HTML, but use CSS to give it some style.
